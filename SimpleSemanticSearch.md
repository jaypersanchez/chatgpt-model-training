Q. When querying "do I like pizza", you'll get the "The best pizza is in Italy.".  You will also get the same result when your query is just "pizza".  How does that become semantic since just the word "pizza" does not have any context?

A. It's essential to understand that the semantic similarity is determined by the embeddings generated by the model. These embeddings capture the context and meaning of a given text, even if it's just a single word.

When you search for the term "pizza," the model generates an embedding for it, which encapsulates the meaning of "pizza" as a food item. The model then compares the query's embedding to the embeddings of the documents in your dataset. Since the document "The best pizza is in Italy." has the strongest contextual association with the word "pizza," it is returned as the most semantically similar result.

It's worth noting that semantic search is not the same as keyword search. Keyword search looks for exact matches in the text, while semantic search tries to capture the meaning and context of the query. Even though your query consists of only one word, "pizza," the model still generates an embedding that captures its meaning, allowing for semantic search.

In the case of the query "do I like pizza," the model generates an embedding that captures the context of liking pizza. Although this query is more specific than just "pizza," the document "The best pizza is in Italy." still has the strongest contextual relationship to the idea of liking pizza within the available documents. As a result, it is returned as the most semantically similar result.
